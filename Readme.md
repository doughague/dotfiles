# Doug's dotfiles

My dotfiles: intended as a repository for my own use, 
but others may find this helpful.

## Install
To download **and install** using git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/doughague/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./install
```

Note that it might be handy to put these files in something like 
`Projects/dotfiles` and sym-link to `~/.dotfiles`. 

## Modify

### GNU stow
GNU Stow is a program, which allows you to create symbolic links out 
of one base directory. The Stow base directory of this template is named 
`.dotfiles` and should be saved in the home folder (`~/.dotfiles`). 

The  stow the base directory should follow a certain structure:
```
~/[stow dir]/[random name]/[content]
~/.dotfiles/git/.gitconfig
```

For example, when executing `stow git`, Stow makes symblolic links from the content 
of the git folder to `~/.gitconfig`.
This also works for home sub-folders like `~/.config`: `~/.dotfiles/config/.config/`


### Private
You can set bash stuff that is not published to git by creating 
a `~/.dotfiles/bash/bash.d/private` file. 
See `~/.dotfiles/bash/bash.d/private.example` for an example.
